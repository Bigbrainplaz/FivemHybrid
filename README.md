## Overview

This script adds a realistic hybrid vehicle system to your FiveM server, enabling vehicles to switch between electric (hybrid) and engine modes based on speed and driver behavior. It supports creep mode and ensures notifications are only sent to the driver.

## Features

- Hybrid Mode: Vehicles start in hybrid mode immediately when the driver enters the vehicle.  
- Speed-Based Switching: Automatically disables hybrid mode above certain speeds and re-enables it after 1 minute 45 seconds of low speed or being stopped.  
- Creep Mode: Optional toggle to simulate slow vehicle movement behavior.  
- Driver-Only Notifications: Chat messages about hybrid status changes are shown only to the driver.  
- Sound Effects: Electric and engine sounds play corresponding to the hybrid mode status.  
- Sync Across Network: Hybrid mode status is synced with the server and other clients.

## Supported Vehicles

- Currently configured for the vehicle model `slick20fpiu`.  
- Electric sound: "voltic"  
- Engine sound: "ecoboostv6"

To add more vehicles, extend the `hybridVehicles` table with your vehicle model hash and associated sounds.
